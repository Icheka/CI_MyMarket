# CI_MyMarket
A package for quickly building the backend for e-commerce sites, written in PHP CodeIgniter.

MyMarket can be used to develop a full-fledged online store (www.leesteff.com).

Ultimately, my goal is to release a complete package that can be used to quickly, efficiently build an online store in a couple of days.
I'm prepared to turn this project open-source but I need dedicated contributors. 
You may contact me: rhemafortune@gmail.com.

I'll improve it and add new features over time.
--- HOW TO USE ---
1) Download (Zip or clone) the files into a NEW folder on your local machine (you don't want to overwrite anything!).
2) Next, manually copy each file to its respective sub-folder within the "application" folder of your CodeIgniter 3 directory. I'll work on namespacing my code so that it never breaks anything of yours.
3) There is no documentation yet, but reading the comments I wrote in the "routes.php" file inside the "config" folder is enough if you know how to call/consume API endpoints.

----
I'll work on the database integration next.
